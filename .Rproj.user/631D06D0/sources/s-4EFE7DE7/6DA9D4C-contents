## Installation and Setup
Install the latest version from github as follows.

```
devtools::install_github('JoseAndresMontes/petfindeR')
```

Each subscriber to the Petfinder API is uniquely identified by an Key and Key Secret, and every request to the API requires a token that can only be accessed by providing both of these credentials. After loading the `petfindeR` package, you should set your Key and Key Secret in your environment as shown below. This facilitates API calls without needing to specify your credentials after first setup.

```
library(petfindeR)
R.home(component = "home")
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Then set your Key and Secret Key exactly like this
```
PETFINDER_APP_KEY = x #Key Sequence
PETFINDER_APP_SECRET = y #Key Secret Sequence
```
